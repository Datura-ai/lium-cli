Lium SDK Documentation
======================

Welcome to the developer documentation for the `lium` Python package. The SDK
provides a clean, Unix-inspired interface for provisioning GPU pods, managing
volumes, and executing remote workloads. These docs are generated directly from
the source tree using Sphinx + autodoc so that Read the Docs can stay in sync
with each release.
